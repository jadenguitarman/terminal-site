				<span>I did some research on <a href="https://www.indeed.com">Indeed.com</a> to come up with the following statistics:</span>
				<span></span>
				<span>There are 953 open web developer jobs in PA.</span>
				<span>They make an average of $74,036 annually.</span>
				<span></span>
				<span>There are 547 open web designer jobs in PA.</span>
				<span>They make an average of $50,840 annually*.</span>
				<span></span>
				<span>According to <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes151134.htm">The National Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, as of May 2018:</span>
				<span>In Pennsylvania, there were 4,610 web developers employed.</span>
				<span>Nationwide, there were 127,300 web developers employed.</span>
				<span>Web developers would do best in Washington, D.C., California, or New York.</span>
				<span>Job availability will rise 13% from 2018 to 2028, a faster than average increase.</span>
				<span></span>
				<span>I would like to eventually be a Senior Front-End Developer.</span>
				<span>It entails doing a lot of work in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.</span>
				<span>It takes leadership skills, since likely it means overseeing others.</span>
				<span>Obviously coding experience is the best thing you can have to qualify for a job in development.</span>
				<span>At least an associate's degree is necessary, but the primary qualifier is experience.</span>
				<span></span>
				<span>I took the Career Test, and my results were:</span>
				<span>Education and Training</span>
				<span>Human Services</span>
				<span>Arts, Audio/Video Technology and Communications</span>
				<span>Business, Management and Administration</span>
				<span>Information Technology</span>
				<span></span>
				<span>According to Career Coach, Web Developers annually make $62,025, and 21 jobs open up.</span>
				<span>The same site says that Web Administrators annually make $83,569, and 144 jobs open up.</span>
